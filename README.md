Style Neutralization Generative Adversarial Classifier

It is the basic code implementation of the paper Style Neutralization Generative Adversarial Classifier in the 9th International Conference of Brain-Inspired Congitive System  (BICS-2018), authored by Haochuan JIANG, Kaizhu HUANG, Rui ZHANG and Amir HUSSAIN from the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, SIP, Suzhou, P.R.China / the Division of Computing Science and Maths, School of Natural Sciences, University of Stirling, Stirling, Scotland, U.K. 

The code is written based on the Tensorflow Deep Learning Library (r1.90, python=2.7). Additional python dependencies are as follows: pip install matplotlib scipy imageio

It is recommended that the python environment is installed on the Anaconda framework.
